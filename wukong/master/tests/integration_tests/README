Integration test in WuKong is very simple

Right now if you want to test component behaviors and how different component
affect each other in a more comprehensive way, start the test_server.py inside
integration_test directory so the generated db file will not be spilling
everywhere following you.

Right now test_server gets its data from test_environment.py in directory
directly above here. You can see that test_environment.py contains python code
to generate a fake environment with whatever node you feel like creating.

All the test data should come from test_environment.py.

That's it. Enjoy your testing, and have a great day.
